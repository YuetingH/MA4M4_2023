# MA4M4 (22/23)
> Support Classes for MA4M4: Topics in Complexity Science at the University of Warwick

We provide guidance on how to use [Python packages](https://www.python.org/) via [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to analyse networks. Please feel free to choose other programming languages, but we will help where we can in this case.

Instructions on how to install Python & Jupyter Notebook can be found online: [Windows](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-in-windows/) | [MacOS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-on-macos/) | [Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-in-linux/)

## Support Class 1 (Week 3)
[SupportClass1.ipynb](https://github.com/YuetingH/MA4M4_2023/blob/main/Support_Class1/SupportClass1.ipynb): This notebook is to give you simple examples of the types of packages you can use to represent networks and compute their basic properties (e.g., [NetWorkX](https://networkx.org/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)). After this class, you should be able to:
- import an empirical network from a website (e.g. [Konect](http://konect.cc/networks/)) into Python
- compute some key network properites (e.g. degree, centrality, average distance)
- visualise a network and its corresponding adjacency matrix in a simple way
