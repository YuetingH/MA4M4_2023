# MA4M4 (22/23)
> Support Classes for MA4M4: Topics in Complexity Science at the University of Warwick

We provide guidance on how to use [Python packages](https://www.python.org/) via [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to analyse networks. Please feel free to choose other programming languages, but we will help where we can in this case.

Instructions on how to install Python & Jupyter Notebook can be found online: [Windows](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-in-windows/) | [MacOS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-on-macos/) | [Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-in-linux/)

## Support Class 1 (Week 3)
[SupportClass1.ipynb](https://github.com/YuetingH/MA4M4_2023/blob/main/Support_Class1/SupportClass1.ipynb): This notebook is to give you simple examples of the types of packages you can use to represent networks and compute their basic properties (e.g., [NetWorkX](https://networkx.org/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)). After this class, you should be able to:
- import an empirical network from a website (e.g. [Konect](http://konect.cc/networks/)) into Jupyter Notebook
- compute some key network properites (e.g. degree, centrality, average distance)
- visualise a network and its corresponding adjacency matrix in a simple way
  
## Lab Class (Week 5-6)
[LabClass.ipynb](https://github.com/YuetingH/MA4M4_2023/blob/main/Lab_Class/LabClass.ipynb): This notebook provides a basic guidance to complete the tasks in [LabClass.pdf](https://github.com/YuetingH/MA4M4_2023/blob/main/Lab_Class/LabClass.pdf). Compared with the previous support class where we provide detailed programming code, our aim of this lab class is to give you an opportunity to practice coding. 

In this lab class, you will
- review some content covered in our last support class (e.g., network visualisation, centrality measures).
- further investigate structural properties of networks (e.g., Laplacian matrix)
- generate random graphs using the Erdös-Rényi model and Barabási–Albert model
- explore community structure using *modularity maximisation* [Optional]
